Сделать бэкап в git 

 bup init
Make a local backup (-v or -vv will increase the verbosity):

 bup index /etc
 bup save -n local-etc /etc
Restore a local backup to ./dest:

 bup restore -C ./dest local-etc/latest/etc
 ls -l dest/etc
Look at how much disk space your backup took:

 du -s ~/.bup
Make another backup (which should be mostly identical to the last one; notice that you don't have to specify that this backup is incremental, it just saves space automatically):

 bup index /etc
 bup save -n local-etc /etc
Look how little extra space your second backup used (on top of the first):

 du -s ~/.bup
Get a list of your previous backups:

 bup ls local-etc
